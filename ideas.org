* Task
We will be looking at the plethora of Dundee GIS data and against that framework be issuing several data sets regarding mobility, air quality and food trading standards. We are aiming to encourage the ability for teams to design mapped visualisations of data across Dundee juxtapositioning layers on top of each other.

* Datasets:
- Speed surveys: XLSX, bins of speed for each street/location at a given date
  - TODO: convert to CSV/dataframe/....
- Weather data: CSV, wind, temp, pressure, humidity, 2017 only
- Electric vehicle charging sessions: CSV
- Air quality: CSV, NO2/PM10
  - Dataset not particularly good quality
- Street lights: CSV, all street lights in city
- Bus stops: CSV/XML, all public transport access nodes in Dundee
- Bicycle parking: geojson, locations of bicycle parking in city
  - Lidar data: how bicycle parking relates to elevation?
- Public CCTV cameras
  - DONE: convert to lat/long
* Ideas
- Are areas with more streetlights more likely to have fewer car crashes? What about cameras?
  - More streetlights could mean easier to drive during the night, or that the area is more well funded, or...

* Project idea
- Analyse: are areas with more streetlights likely to have fewer car crashes?
- Premise: areas with more streetlights could be better funded, or streetlights could mean easier to drive during the night
- Data: 
  - [[https://data.dundeecity.gov.uk/dataset/street-lights][Streetlights]]
  - [[https://data.dundeecity.gov.uk/dataset/os-open-map-local-dnd][OS Open Map Local]] (for visualisation)
  - [[https://data.dundeecity.gov.uk/dataset/road-safety-data][Road Safety Data]] (use 2016 only)
- Analysis method:
  - Plot out streetlights, accidents
    - See if anything pops out just by looking at an analysis?
  - Label each point with distance to nearest streetlight
  - Crunch numbers!
